# Steam Deck Bullet Hell Game

🚀 A fast-paced bullet hell game built with **Godot Engine** and **C++**, designed and optimized for the **Steam Deck**. The game blends elements of **platformers** and **top-down shooters**, with a focus on responsive controls, tight gameplay, and satisfying visual feedback.
